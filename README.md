# Assignment #2 - Java Guessing Game

## Unit 3-4 Java Basics

In this second assignment we are given the task to create a game that allows players to try to guess a number that's randomly chosen between 1 and 100.

I can see this as a fun assingmnet to come back to and build out a few more features such as Players being able to type in their own name/handle and if you'd like to restart the app after it's complete you can enter 'y'.
